### own your data :zap: empower your world

Decentralized identity client powered by [Zilliqa](https://zilliqa.com)

For the management of your Decentralized Identifier (DID), `Tyron` implements [Sidetree delta-based DID-operations](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/#did-operations) and saves the state in a [Scilla smart-contract](https://scilla-lang.org/) that is owned by you, the user.

## Problem summary

Identities on the internet remain centralized, mainly by identity providers such as Facebook, Google or PayPal. Thus, when people shop online and login with these accounts, they don't have enough control nor understanding of how their data is used and shared with third parties.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) allows people to manage their digital identities, proving who they are without a middleman, by anchoring Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on blockchain platforms/distributed-ledgers as a shared root of trust. However, most DLTs still can't provide decentralized identity at scale. By implementing Decentralized Identifiers powered by Sidetree & Scilla, tyronZIL aims to solve this issue to enable user-controlled digital identities.
