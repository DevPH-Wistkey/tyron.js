## Problem summary

Identities on the internet remain centralized, mainly by identity providers such as Facebook, Google or PayPal. Thus, when people shop online and login with these accounts, they don't have enough control nor understanding of how their data is used and shared with third parties.

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) allows people to prove who they are without a middleman, by anchoring decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on distributed ledgers as a shared root of trust. However, most DLTs still can't provide SSI applications at scale. The [Sidetree protocol](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) aims to solve this issue, and tyronZIL implements it for the Zilliqa blockchain platform.
